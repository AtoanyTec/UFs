# 🧠📸 Skin Lesion Classification with CNN (ISIC2019)

## 🚀 Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common diseases worldwide, and early detection is critical for successful treatment. In recent years, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — has shown great potential in medical image analysis.

In this project, you will develop a deep learning model capable of classifying skin lesions using the **ISIC 2019 dataset (International Skin Imaging Collaboration)**. This challenge simulates a real-world AI application in healthcare, combining technical skills with critical thinking and ethical awareness.
