# 🔬 Activity: Applying the Scientific Method to Your Research Topic

## 🎯 Objective
Use **your own research topic** to identify and clearly explain **each step of the scientific method**, demonstrating scientific thinking, logical reasoning, and clarity.

---

## ⏱️ Duration
⏳ 50–60 minutes

---

## 🧠 Scientific Method Steps
You will work through the following steps:

1️⃣ Observation  
2️⃣ Question  
3️⃣ Hypothesis  
4️⃣ Experiment  
5️⃣ Results  
6️⃣ Conclusion  

---

## 📝 Instructions

### 🟢 Step 1: Research Topic
Write your **research topic** clearly at the top of your document.

📌 *Example:*  
> How does temperature affect plant growth?

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Observation
Describe **what you observed** that made you interested in this topic.

✔ Based on real-life situations, prior knowledge, or research  
✔ Describe a phenomenon, not an opinion  

📌 *Example:*  
> Plants in warmer environments seem to grow faster.

---

### ❓ Step 3: Research Question
Turn your observation into a **clear, scientific question**.

✔ Must be testable  
✔ Directly related to your observation  

📌 *Example:*  
> How does temperature affect the growth rate of plants?

---

### 🧪 Step 4: Hypothesis
Write a **prediction or possible explanation**.

✔ Use an *if–then* statement  
✔ Must be testable  

📌 *Example:*  
> If plants are grown at higher temperatures, then they will grow faster.

---

### ⚙️ Step 5: Experiment
Explain **how you would test your hypothesis**.

Include:
- 🧷 Variables (independent, dependent, controlled)
- 🧰 Materials
- 🔄 Procedure (step-by-step)
- 📊 How data will be collected

📌 *Example:*  
> Grow identical plants at different temperatures and measure their height every week.

---

### 📈 Step 6: Results
Describe **the data you expect to obtain**.

✔ Measurements, tables, or observations  
✔ Can be expected results if the experiment is not performed  

📌 *Example:*  
> Plants grown at 25 °C grew taller than those at 15 °C.

---

### 🧠 Step 7: Conclusion
Explain what the results mean.

✔ Did the results support your hypothesis?  
✔ What did you learn?  
✔ What could be improved or studied next?

📌 *Example:*  
> The hypothesis was supported because higher temperatures increased plant growth.
