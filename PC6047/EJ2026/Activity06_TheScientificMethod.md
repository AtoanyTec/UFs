# 🔬 Activity: The Scientific Method to Your Research Topic

## 🎯 Objective
Use **your own research topic** to identify and clearly explain **each step of the scientific method**, demonstrating scientific thinking, logical reasoning, and clarity.

---

## ⏱️ Duration
⏳ 50–60 minutes

---

## 🧠 Scientific Method Steps
You will work through the following steps:

1️⃣ Observation  
2️⃣ Question  
3️⃣ Hypothesis  
4️⃣ Experiment  
5️⃣ Results  
6️⃣ Conclusion  

---

## 📝 Instructions

### 🟢 Step 1: Research Topic
Write your **research topic** clearly at the top of your document.

📌 *Example:*  
> How does temperature affect plant growth?

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Observation
Describe **what you observed** that made you interested in this topic.

✔ Based on real-life situations, prior knowledge, or research  
✔ Describe a phenomenon, not an opinion  

📌 *Example:*  
> Plants in warmer environments seem to grow faster.

---

### ❓ Step 3: Research Question
Turn your observation into a **clear, scientific question**.

✔ Must be testable  
✔ Directly related to your observation  

📌 *Example:*  
> How does temperature affect the growth rate of plants?

---

### 🧪 Step 4: Hypothesis
Write a **prediction or possible explanation**.

✔ Use an *if–then* statement  
✔ Must be testable  

📌 *Example:*  
> If plants are grown at higher temperatures, then they will grow faster.

---

### ⚙️ Step 5: Experiment
Explain **how you would test your hypothesis**.

Include:
- 🧷 Variables (independent, dependent, controlled)
- 🧰 Materials
- 🔄 Procedure (step-by-step)
- 📊 How data will be collected

📌 *Example:*  
> Grow identical plants at different temperatures and measure their height every week.

---

### 📈 Step 6: Results
Describe **the data you expect to obtain**.

✔ Measurements, tables, or observations  
✔ Can be expected results if the experiment is not performed  

📌 *Example:*  
> Plants grown at 25 °C grew taller than those at 15 °C.

| **Criteria** | **95-100 🏆** | **85-94 👍** | **75-84 ⚠️** | **0-74 ❌** |
|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Observation** | Observation is clear, relevant, and scientifically grounded | Observation is clear but lacks depth | Observation is vague or partially relevant | Observation is unclear or missing |
| **Research Question** | Question is precise, testable, and well-formulated | Question is testable but could be clearer | Question is weak or poorly defined | Question is missing or not testable |
| **Hypothesis** | Logical, testable, and clearly linked to the question | Testable and related to the question | Partially testable or unclear | Hypothesis is missing or incorrect |
| **Experiment Design** | Well-structured, includes variables, materials, and clear procedure | Mostly complete, minor details missing | Limited explanation, missing key elements | Experiment not described or incorrect |
| **Results** | Results are clearly described and logically presented | Results are understandable but lack detail | Results are unclear or incomplete | Results are missing |
| **Conclusion** | Strong interpretation supported by results and reflection | Conclusion relates to results | Weak or superficial conclusion | Conclusion missing or incorrect |
| **Organization & Clarity** | Excellent structure and scientific language | Clear structure with minor issues | Some organization problems | Poorly organized and unclear |
