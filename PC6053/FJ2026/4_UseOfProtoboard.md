# 🔌💡 Use of Protoboard

## 🎯 Objective
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- Identify the main parts of a **protoboard (breadboard)** 🧩  
- Correctly connect an **LED** and a **resistor** 🔴  
- Understand why resistors are needed to protect LEDs ⚡  
- Build and simulate a simple circuit in **Tinkercad** 💻  

---

## ⏱️ Duration
**30 minutes**

---

## 🛠️ Tool
💻 **Tinkercad – Circuits**

---

## 📚 Materials (Virtual)
- Protoboard (Breadboard)  
- LED 🔴  
- Resistor (220 Ω or 330 Ω)  
- Power supply (5V)
- Jumper wires  

---

## 🧠 Before You Start (5 min)
Remember:
- A **protoboard** lets you build circuits without soldering 🧱  
- An **LED** has polarity:
  - Long leg → **Anode (+)**  
  - Short leg → **Cathode (–)**  
- A **resistor** limits current and protects the LED 🛡️  

⚠️ **Never connect an LED directly to power without a resistor!**

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions (15 min)

### 1️⃣ Open Tinkercad
- Go to **Tinkercad → Circuits**
- Click **Create New Circuit** ➕

### 2️⃣ Add Components
Drag the following to your workspace:
- Protoboard  
- LED  
- Resistor (220 Ω or 330 Ω)  
- Power supply (5V) or Arduino  

### 3️⃣ Place the LED
- Insert the **long leg (anode +)** into one row of the breadboard  
- Insert the **short leg (cathode –)** into a different row  

### 4️⃣ Add the Resistor
- Connect **one end of the resistor** to the LED anode (+)  
- Connect the **other end of the resistor** to **+5V**  

### 5️⃣ Complete the Circuit
- Connect the **LED cathode (–)** to **GND (–)**  
- Use jumper wires as needed 🔗  

### 6️⃣ Simulate
- Click **Start Simulation ▶️**
- 🎉 Your LED should turn ON!

## 🔬 Experiment & Think (7 min)
Try the following and observe what happens:

- 🔄 Flip the LED direction — does it turn on?
- ❌ Remove the resistor — what do you notice?
- 🔢 Change the resistor value — does the brightness change?

✍️ Write short answers (1–2 sentences) for each case.

---

## 📦 Deliverable
Submit:
- 📸 A screenshot of your working circuit in Tinkercad  
- 📝 Short answers to the experiment questions  

---

## 🤔 Reflection (3 min)
Answer briefly:
- Why is LED polarity important?  
- Why do we need a resistor?  
- How does the protoboard help you build circuits faster?

---

## ⭐ Optional Challenge
If you finish early:
- Add a **second LED** 🌈  
- Try a different LED color  
- Control the LED using an **Arduino pin** 🤖  

🚀 Great job exploring basic electronics!
