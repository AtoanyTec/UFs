## ⚙️ What is Engineering?

**Engineering** is the discipline focused on **solving real-world problems** using knowledge from **science, mathematics, and technology**. Its main goal is not only to build things, but to **design useful, efficient, and responsible solutions** that address needs in the environment.

An engineer:

- 🔍 Identifies a problem  
- 🧠 Analyzes its causes  
- 📊 Evaluates different solutions  
- 🛠️ Designs and builds a system  
- 🧪 Tests, improves, and optimizes the solution  

Engineering always considers real-world constraints, such as:

- 💰 Cost  
- ⏱️ Time  
- 🔋 Available resources  
- 🌱 Environmental impact  
- 👥 People’s safety  

Examples of engineering in everyday life:

- 💡 Automatic lighting  
- ❄️ Air conditioning systems  
- 🚦 Intelligent traffic lights  
- 📱 Electronic devices  

👉 In this course, engineering is understood as a **thinking process**, where every decision must be justified and the solution must demonstrate that it works in a real context.

## 🤖 What is Applied Robotics?

**Applied robotics** is the use of robotics to **solve real and specific problems**, integrating **hardware, software, and control logic** into a functional system.

An applied robotics system is made up of three main elements:

### 🟢 Sensors  
Allow the system to perceive its environment (e.g., PIR sensors, temperature, light).

### 🧠 Processing  
Where sensor data is analyzed and decisions are made through programming.

### 🔵 Actuators  
Carry out a physical action (turning on a light, moving a motor, activating an alarm).

Unlike theoretical robotics, applied robotics:

- ✔️ Operates in real-world conditions  
- ✔️ Considers energy efficiency  
- ✔️ Aims to be reliable and safe  
- ✔️ Has a clear purpose  

Everyday examples of applied robotics:

- 🚪 Automatic doors  
- 🧹 Cleaning robots  
- 💡 Energy-saving systems  
- 🏫 Smart classrooms

## 🌍 Engineering and Robotics with Impact

When we combine **engineering** and **applied robotics**, we can create solutions that:

- ♻️ Save energy  
- 🌱 Protect the environment  
- 🏫 Improve educational spaces  
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Help people  

In this course, your project must not only **work**, but also:

- 📖 Be well justified  
- 🔍 Solve a real problem  
- 🧩 Integrate sensors, programming, and actuators  
- 🎤 Be presented and technically defended

## 🚀 Final Message

> **Engineering does not start with wires, it starts with a question.**  
> **Applied robotics turns that question into a real solution.**

Get ready to design, build, and demonstrate your project! 💪🤖
